Instead, it might be more helpful for researchers to explore their data, and test assumptions on their own to determine 'what level of assumption-violation' might they be willing to accept given they are experts in their fields and have domain-specific contextual knowledge. This is not to say that assumptions can be violated without consequences.\n\nAlso, it might be difficult to determine the thresholds for having actually met or not met an assumption. Thus, a function which simply outputs a 'yes' or 'no' to whether assumptions for a particular regression implementation have been met did not seem appropriate. We therefore, test assumptions by intentionally breaking them and noting the extent of bias-ness that they result. \n",
