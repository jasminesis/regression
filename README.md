# Regression

DIY Regression project for Stats Consulting
Fall 2023
Jasmine Siswandjo and Saumya Seth

1. Linear regression - Saumya
2. Probit regression - Saumya
3. Negative Binomial regression - Saumya
4. Logistic regression - Jasmine
5. Poisson regression  - Jasmine
6. Zero-inflated Poisson regression - Jasmine

Goals of the Project: 
- To implement our own functions for regression without using in-built regression packages in R. We will estimate coefficients of the predictors, estimate their standard errors, and calculate the p-values of said models
- To highlight and check the assumptions of each model
- To discuss the implications of breaking assumptions for the models
- To discuss the applications of the models and compare and contrast situations where certain models may perform better than others
