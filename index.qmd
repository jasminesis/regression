1.  Linear regression
2.  Probit regression
3.  Negative Binomial regression
4.  Logistic regression
5.  Poisson regression\
6.  Zero-inflated Poisson regression

For each of the 6 regression types, we implemented our own functions without using in-built regression packages in R. We estimated coefficients of the predictors, estimated their standard errors, and calculated the p-values of said models.

We also explored and checked the assumptions of each model, and discussed the implications of breaking those assumptions.
